infrastructure as code

TERRAFORM USED TO CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE USING CODE

we can use Cloud Formation also but, that is only specific to AWS  cloud only
but, teraform supports multi cloud like aws , gcp, azure etc.

we can create infrasturcture using code in any cloud by using terraform.


go to ==> https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

select 64-bit windows

once downloaded extract it to any location you want


> terraform refresh  ===> refresh the terraform view what cloud i am using

> terraform plan     ===> which tell you what you are going to do and what is real world.  real world <--> real world

> terraform apply    ===> To create the desired infrastructure 

> terraform destroy  ===> it will destroy the infrastructre created using Terraform apply.



create a dir under terraform installed directory.

> first we need to give access to terraform for aws cloud

> go to aws >> iam >> user >> username >> programatic access >> policies >> administrator >> create >> downalod csv file.

copy access key id, secrect key and save in notepad++


create a file with the name "terraform.tfvars"

AWS_ACCESS_KEY = paste the saved access key.
AWS_SECRET_KEY = paste the saved secrect key.



create a file with name "providers.tf"

provider "aws"{
	access_key = paste access key
        secrect_key = paste secrect key

terraform connect internet and try to download plugin for aws.


instance.tf

resource "aws_instance" "web_Test(give any name here)" {
	ami = "ami-id"
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
	AWS_REGION= "us-west-1"
}

> terraform fmt  ===>  this will format the terraform script.

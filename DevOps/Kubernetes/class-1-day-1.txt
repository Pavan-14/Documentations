Kubernetes
===========
it is used to manage the containers.
containers may be docker or any other

kubernetes is a container orchestration tool

Popular container orchestration tools
-------------------------------------
docker swarm
kubernetes by google
mesos

Kebenetes support all cloud providers like aws, gcp, azure etc

Now a days developemt is moving from monolith to microservices.
to run microservices they are deployed to containers.
to manage all this microservice docker containers we are using kubernetes.


Kubernetes cluster

control plane
1. control manger
2. ccm  ==> cloud control manger
3. api server
4. etcd ==> key vlaue pair database
5. sheduler ==> this will put contianer in a high available node in the cluster

nodes

each node have 2 components
1. kubelet  ===>  checks the status of node and communicate to the control manager.
2. Kproxy   ===>  to communicate between cotainer nodes
node is nothing but a server(like ec2 instance)
nodes will run our docker containers

each node connects to the api server in control plane using kublets or k-proxy.


control manager
---------------

Desired state: 6 containers ===> always desired number of containers should run
Current state: 5 containers ===> how many nodes are running currently
one node goes down it will compare desired state and spin up node according to deifined state.


Node
----
node is nothing but 1 ec2 server
1 node can have multiple pods
based on ec2 type the capacity of pods can run vary.

pod
---
it's a small unit where container will run
1 pod will run 1 container only.
each pod will have unique ip address

when we terminate and launched new pod the ip will change
to overcome this behaviour we use concept called "service"

we will map service with pod, this service will have fixed ip. (this is like Elastic IP in AWS)

engress ==> this map the ip to a user frendly name. (this like DNS maping)


Deployment
----------
replica set(rs) make sure the number Desired state nodes are running.

EKS

jenkins git hub job to get code from repo
-----------------------------------------
1. polling
2. webhook

polling
-------
configure cron job in jenkins to check repo
for every period of time.

webhook
-------
create a webhook in git repo, when code is pushed
jenkins job starts and pull the code from repo

polling waste server resources by checking all 
the time for changes in repo code. we don't know
when developers push the latest changes.

Job is also called "project"
linting => to check the file format is correct or not

Queue => jobs are in queue when we create ajob, 
jenkins execute jobs sequentially/.

plugins => these plugins provide extra functionality to jenkins

Build => it is a result of single execution of project

Build step => it is one task with in a project

Artifacts
==========
heloworld.java
javac heloworld.java =>  when we run/compile this file in jenkins .class file generated
this compilation files stored as artifacts.

all the files generated while code compiling/build in jenkins are stored as Artifacts.


=> Jenkins file is a file where we write pipeline as code using declarative syntax

=> Jenkins config file to change Port of Jenkins
=============

	Project/Job types in Jenkins
	============================

1. Free-style
=============
general purpose/common jobs , most flexibile and configurable, the build step for this type of project is shell script/windows commands.
Ex: file is there, file has permission or not and execute the shell command.
we use when we have simple requrements like executing shell/windows commands.
this type have full control and 100% customigabile.

2. Pipeline
===========
this is called as workflow written in DSL(Domain specific language).
we use this when requirement is not fulfill by Free-style.
little complicated project than free-style/ multi node project(need to run job in multiple nodes)
Ex: cloning the repo and compiling the code and build it.
when we have to use separate Build tool.

Build Tools
===========
Apache Maven
ANT

these tools helps with build

when we installed plugin in jenkins, first go to "global tool configuration" and configure the plugin settings.

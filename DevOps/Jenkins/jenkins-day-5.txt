Jenkins pipeline as a code
--------------------------
new item => pipeline ==> advanced projects options ==> pipeline script ==> write declarative pipeline script

pipleline{
	agent any
	environment {}
	stages{
		stage("stage name-clone repo"){
			steps{
				git branch :'main' url: "repo url"
			}
		}

		stage("stage name-Build"){
			steps{
				echo "fjlkjlkjf"
				cat file1.txt
			}
		}
		
		stage("Test"){
			steps{
				cd ..
				another command
			}
		}

		stage("Deploy"){
			steps{
				cd ..
				another command
			}
		}
}


we can check the pipeline syntax
if we don't know the script to check for file exists are not, we can generate script snippet using pipeline syntax


by source code file in repo
----------------------------
vscode => new file => file name "jenkinsfile"

paste declarative pipeline in the jenkinsfile

save.

push to repo

=========================
Writing ansible playbooks
=========================
Ansible playbooks uses YAML format

playbook is a sequence of ordered tasks

---
-name : creating users (# playbook name)
 hosts : all
 become : true (# to become sudo user)
 vars:
   -username : give user name
 tasks:
 - name : first user creation(# task name)
   user :
     name: user_name (or) give variable [ex: "{{ username }}"]     comment: full name of user/anything we can give

save and exit.

> ansible all --list -hosts  (list of slave hosts)

> ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml --check  ===> to check syntax

> ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml ===> to run playbook

When we run a playbook ansible will run a predefined task "Gathering facts" 
This Task will get all details like OS, OS version, kernal, python version. python path, ..etc.

This command "ansible all -m setup" will run in background of Gathering facts task.

we use this information for writting conditional playbooks.

giving variable at runtime
--------------------------
> ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml -e "username=testuser"

Now, this username value overrides the username value given in playbook


giving variable from file
-------------------------
var_files:
  -file.yml

To stop/not run default gathering facts task
============================================
open playbook and below line after become.

gather_facts: no  # to not run default gathering facts


> ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml --list-hosts --list-tasks   # to list all hosts and tasks
we have to run this command everytime before running playbook.


But in ubuntu server yum will not work, installing task will fail on ubuntu.

to solve this

gather info about ubuntu host

> ansible host_ip -m setup

copy ansible_os_family

now open playbook

-name: installing tree in Redhat
    yum:
      name: tree
      state: present/installed
    when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

-name: installing tree in ubuntu
    apt:
      name: tree
      state: present/installed
    when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

if when condition evaluate to true then only
that task will run.

Note: if tree is not installing on ubuntu, first update the apt-get repositiry "sudo apt-get update".


installing httpd
================
install_httpd.yml

---
-name: play book name
 hosts: host inventory file/all
 become: true
 gather_facts: no  # to not run default gathering facts 
 vars:

   -name: installing httpd in ubuntu
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present    (# for apt)
    when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

...

> ansible-playbook install_httpd.yml --check   # to check for syntax mistakes

> ansible-playbook install_httpd.yml --list-hosts --list-tasks

> which apache2  # where apache2 is installed

Ansibile
========
Ansible written in python.

python should be installed before installing ansible.

it's used to install softwares like webservers like tomcat, nginx, etc

ansible works on master-slave architecture

master is only linux system.
slaves can be anything (linux/windows/mac etc)

ansible uses YAML syntax

ansible is agentless. it's open ssh model.

master node connected with shh to all slave nodes.
but master node should have the information about
slave nodes.
this information in maintained in a file called
as "Host/Inventory" file

playbooks ===> contains sequence of instructions/tasks want to execute on
slave nodes.

modules ==> it's like python modules kind of. to perform some actions we have some default modules to do that.

inventory have groups
each group will have hosts/salves servers to manage.
so, can push to perticular group of hosts/slaves instead of push to all servers.


Ansible Installation
====================
3 servers
1 -master server
2 -slaves servers

1. cerate new EC2 instance and connect to it.

2. hostname ==> it gives host name. ip address

3. hostname Ansible-master-node ===> changing the host name

4. if we reboot instance it will erased.

5. sudo vi /ect/hostname

Enter host name and save it.
now hostname change is permenante. if reboot instance also it won't change

cat /etc/passwd ===> to see all users info in EC2 instance.

6. useradd AnsiAdmin ===> creating dedicated user to ansible.

7. passwd AnsiAdmin(username) ===> set password to user
enter password
enter password again

8. visudo
shift+g ===> to come down

Allow root to run any
AnsiAdmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

save and exit.

9. vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  ==> to make sure password authentication is yes

/password ==> to search for password in vi editor

i ===> to insert mode

PasswordAuthentication yes ==> uncomment this line
PasswordAuthentication no  ==> comment this line

save and exit.

10. service sshd restart / restart sshd.service / systemctl restart sshd

11. sudo su AnsiAdmin ==> login as Ansible user

12. ssh-keygen  ==> generate ssh keys

13. sudo yum install python3

14. sudo yum install python3-pip

15. sudo pip install ansible

16. ansible --version

17. cd /etc/ ==> to see ansible dir is there or not

18. mkdir /etc/ansible/

19. ls -la

20. sudo touch ansible.cfg   ===> create ansible configuration file

21. search for ansible configuration file in google.
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/ansible.cfg
copy the file

22. sudo vi ansible.cfg

paste it and save and exit.

23. cat ansible.cfg | grep -i inventory

24. sudo touch hosts

[webserveres]
ip-1
ip-2

[db_server]
ip-3
ip-4

[app_servers]
ip-5
ip-6

25. ansible -i full path of custom_inventory_file  -m ping   ===>   To override default invetory file(/etc/ansible/hosts)

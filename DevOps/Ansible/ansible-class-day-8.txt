ansible roles
===============
roles are used to break down the playbooks into small chunks

creating role

> cd /etc/ansible/

> sudo mkdir roles

> cd roles/

> sudo mkdir apache(role name)

> sudo mkdir defaults files handlers meta templates tasks vars

> every directory should have a main.yml file.

> cd tasks/

> sudo vi main.yml

    - name: "installing httpd on aws linux"
      yum:
        name: "httpd"
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      tags: "install_httpd"
      notify: "start_httpd"

    - name: Ensure the Default Apache port is {{port}}
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        regexp: '^Listen'
        insertafter: '^#Listen'
        line: Listen {{port}}
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      nofity: restart apache httpd
   

copy all the tasks to this file and save.

> cd handelrs/

> sudo vi main.yml

    - name: "start_httpd"
      service:
        name: "httpd"
        state: started
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: restart apache httpd
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

copy the all handler tasks to this file


> cd vars/

> sudo vi main.yml

port = 8081

copy all varibles in this file and save.


> cd defaults/

> sudo vi main.yml

port = 8080

if port varible is not given in vars/main.yml file then port is taken from defaults/main.yml


> cd files/

place the files which you want to move to slaves.


Now go to playbook
add below lines

roles:
 - role1
 - role2




> cd /etc/ansible/roles/

go to ansible galaxy website and serach for roles for httpd

copy the url and type the command

> ansible-galaxy paste the url

this will create all folders and files under
"/home/username/.ansible/" directory


ansible galaxy is nothing but like a github, where all pre-created roles are there for every service.

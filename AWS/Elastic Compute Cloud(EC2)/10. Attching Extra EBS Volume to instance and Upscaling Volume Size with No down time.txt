Attach Additional EBS
=====================
> df -h
> df -PH
> df -hT

> lsblk     # Verify the attached EBS volumes are recognized (except RAM disks).shows in a tree-like format by default.

> sudo file -s "EBS volume NAME" (ex: /dev/xvdf)    # This is used to check data is present or not in the newly Attched EBS  volume"

> mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf   # To make file system for EBS volume to be used by instance

After creating file system, again check data is available in EBS volume
> sudo file -s "EBS volume NAME"

copy the "UUID=4121cfdd-9786-490a-ab37-4f564a8208ac"

> cd /   # change to root directory

> mkdir /ExtEBS   

> sudo mount /dev/xvdf /ExtEBS


if we reboot instance, in sometimes EBS volume may detach automatically, to avoid this we need to add the volume UUID in a file called "fstab"

> sudo vi /etc/fstab
paste the copied UUID in below format

UUID=4121cfdd-9786-490a-ab37-4f564a8208ac     /ExtEBS     ext4   defaults,nofail   0   2


Detach Additional EBS
======================
first unmount 

> unmount /ExtEBS 

then got to console, and detach the vloume and delete it.


Note:
-----
we can upscale Attached EBS volume size with no down time from console.
